A.  Libraries

Frontend:

Body-parser: Body-parser is an npm library used to process data sent through an HTTP request body. It parses request and converts it into a format that can help developers extract data easily.

Semantic UI: Semantic UI is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML. It allows me to design UI interface faster.

Backend:

Axios: Axios promises based HTTP client for the brower and node.js. The advantage of Axios is that it automatically converts the data to JSON. It also supports wide brosers.

Express: Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. 

mongoose: The reason why I chose Express is that it supprts Node.js so that I can develop an Express.js backend with NPM packages.

B.  List items:

The schema I store in the database is 
title: String,
    completed: Boolean,
The format is JSON.
Title means the to-do list text, so it’s stored as string. Completed is to record if the to-do list item is completed, so it’s stored as boolean.

C.  Deployment architecture:
I chose Heroku to deploy the project because it is free and easier for beginners. I separated front end part and back end part to deploy to two different websites. 

D.  What part of this project you had never done before:
I never deployed project before. However, I think Heroku is a could platform that good for beginners.
